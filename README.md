# You-Shall-Not-Pass

You-Shall-Not-Pass is a Gate Access Control system that leverages image processing techniques for enhanced security. This project aims to provide a robust and efficient solution for gate access control using computer vision.

## Features

- **Object Detection:** Utilizes advanced image processing algorithms for real-time object detection.
- **Access Control:** Grant or deny access based on recognized objects and predefined criteria.
- **Security:** Enhance the security of gated areas with intelligent visual monitoring.
- **Open Source:** This project is open source, encouraging collaboration and contributions from the community.
